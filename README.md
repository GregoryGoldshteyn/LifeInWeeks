# Life In Weeks

## My Life in Weeks

This is a digitization of the life calendar from this [Kurzgesagt YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXeJANDKwDc).

I found the idea of tracking the progress of my life in weeks fascinating, but wanted more flexibility than a simple tick down poster.

I came up with this; a simple website that reads and displays each week by year. With this format, it's possible to add data to each week to mark notable events week by week.

At the moment, it only tracks my life through a single JSON file. The project could be expanded in scope to read from a database that hosts multiple users, but I want to keep it simple for now; an exercise in front end work.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
